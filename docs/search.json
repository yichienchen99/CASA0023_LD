    "text": "1.1 Summary\n\n1.1.1 Sensors\nPassive\n\nAttribute: Sun energy reflection in EM wave, don’t emit EM waves\nExample: human eyes, satellite (e.g. Wk2 sensor summary - WorldView-3)\n❌ Influenced by atmosphere haze(require atmosphere correction, no haze in outer space due to no atmosphere) and scattering (wavelength (e.g. blue sky and orange sunset)), clouds and weather\n✔️ does not disturb the object or area of interest\n\nActive\n\nAttribute: Emit and receive EM wave / energy\nExample: radar, x-ray, LiDAR\n✔️ can pass clouds\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Four resolutions\n\nSpatial\n\nthe size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)\nLow spatial resolution: fast (short revisit time); High spatial resolution: costly\n\nSpectral\n\nSpectral signature (EM): Objects on Earth have difference wavelengths = Bands\n\nMulti-spectral data / image\nHyperspectral data / image: stack all colour bands\n\nTrue colour (human eye can see) and false colour (human cant see)\n❌ atmospheric window (atmospheric transmission / opacity, e.g. water vapour, ozone, CO…)\nSpectroradiometer\n\nRadiometric\n\nidentify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.\nIncrease bit -> increase possible values\n8-bit sensor: 0-255; 11-bit sensor: 0-2047\nSentinel-2 is 12-bit (brightness levels from 0 – 4095) (beyond True Colour Image (TCI) values)\n\nTemporal\n\nRevisit time of sensor\nHigh resolution / pixel -> low revisit = low cost and number [graph]\n\n\nTrade off between resolution and time (and cost)\n\n\n1.1.3 Practical\nOverview/Workflow (SNAP):\nDownload -> New project in SNAP -> Save downloaded file in a Data folder in the same directory as the project -> Open product/zipped data -> Select RGB-image channel (on product explorer panel right click product) => Fig. a,b,c\nTo inspect/change image display: -> Colour Manipulation panel (View -> Tool Windows) -> Change the range of histogram\nTo analyse spectral feature space: -> Scatter plot (under Analysis tab) => Fig. d\nTo mask the study area: -> Resampling to 20m (since both masking and the Tasseled Cap function require same resolution while B2/B3/B4/B8 are 10m and B11/B12 are 20m) -> Import vector (ESRI shapefile) -> Select the imported layer in layer manager -> Masking under Raster - Masks - Land/Sea Mask (select bands that would be used)\nTo reduce dimensionality via Tasseled Cap transformation : -> Apply transformation functions in Band Math -> Select RGB-image channel => Fig. e,f\nSince Landsat has different spatial resolution than Sentinel, the latter will be resampled again (upscale). And since the Sentinel data has been masked/selected useful bands for Tasseled cap, it will be masked again to select B1-B7.\nTo compare spectral reflectance: -> Make sure both data in the same resolution with the same bands -> Add polygons by land cover -> Export polygons as shapefiles -> Export both dataset as GeoTIFF -> Check in QGIS -> Compare in R using terra (or stars) => Fig. g,h & Table 1\n\n1.1.3.1 Sentinel and Landsat\n\nData availability depends on cloud cover, time, weather (sometimes study area may not have data under the filtered criteria)\nSentinel tends to have shorter download time than Landsat.\nLandsat has less available data in a given time range (due to slightly longer revisit time).\n\n\nSentinel and Landsat data in QGIS and SNAP\n\n\n\nSentinel-2\nLandsat (8-9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS))\n\n\n\n\nSpatial resolution\nResolutions varied for each bands. (E.g. 10m resolution for Band 2)\n30m resolution\n\n\nTemporal resolution\n10 days (5 days for combined constellation 2A & 2B)\n16 days\n\n\nSpectral resolution\n13 spectral bands\n9 spectral bands\n\n\nCentral wavelength\nB1 443nm = Band 1 has central wavelength of 442 nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess by Software\nQGIS\nSNAP\n\n\nColour composite\nmerge the BOA bands (B2, B3, B4, B8) to make true colour composite (B1=Blue, B2=Green, B3=Red)\nrecreate by changing RBG channels (Fig. a, b, c)\n\n\nEnhancement\nContrast enhancement\nImage histogram\n\n\nSpectral feature space\n\nScatter plot (Fig. d)\n\n\nResampling\n\nB11 and B12 are at a 20m resolution whereas all the others at a 10m resolution. -> resample others to 20m (upscale) Sentinel 2 resampling toolbox\n\n\n\n\nA) Traditional resample: considers the neighbouring pixels (time-efficient?)\nB) Sentinel 2 products resample: account for the particularities of the angle (satellite viewing) bands\n\n\nMasking\n\nMasks.

Then change RGB channel to those new data to show results (Fig. e)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3.2 Masking vs. cropping\n\nmasking: the outline of the geo boundary\ncropping: to the extent, the rectangular parameter of the geo boundary\n\n\n\n1.1.3.3 Example: Processing of Sentinel and Landsat data of Kinmen County\nI’ve chosen Kinmen County in Taiwan as my case study area for practical. It consists of several islands and is in close proximity to Xiamen, China. The main/largest island is the H-shaped one at the lower end of the first few maps (or see Fig. e).\nThis is where i spent the majority of summer in 2022 so i’ve got some knowledge of the city/island’s land use. I also cycled a lot on this island (so having some sense of the topography). It is really enjoyable to cycle here as there is less traffic and more greenery. However, it tends to be slightly cloudy/rainy in certain months which may constrain the analysis. Anyhow, let’s see how it goes.\n\n1.1.3.3.1 Sentinel\nThe initial exploration using Sentinel data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Natural colour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb) False colour composite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc) Atmospheric penetration composite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd) Scatter plot (B4 Red - B8 NIR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse colour composite: B8, B4, B3. Plants reflect near-infrared and green light whilst absorbing red.\nAtmospheric penetration composite: B12, B11, B8A with no visible bands to penetrate atmospheric particles. Vegetation = blue, urban area = white, gray cyan or purple.\n\nBasically, Fig a,b,c show that the coastal city Xiamen’s built-up areas are mostly close to the seashore. This is mainly due to its historical ports that are open to international trades and thus becoming more urbanized. Kinmen Islands are less populous compared to Xiamen and the majority of land is bare soil / vegetation. Fig d shows that the dry bare soil is prominent in some areas (black dots at high B4 and high B8), while the image has large ratio of biomass (yellow peak at low B4 and high B8).\n\n\n1.1.3.3.2 Tasseled Cap function\nArcPro’s explanation:\nThe function is originally designed to monitor crop’s life cycle / changes through time.\n\nBrightness = bare or partially covered soil, man-made, and natural features such as concrete, asphalt, gravel, rock outcrops, and other bare areas\nGreenness = green vegetation\nWetness = soil moisture, water, and other moist features.\n\n✔️ Those three components of imagery contain about 97% of the meaningful information available in the image (removing noise and atmospheric effects).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne) PCA / Tasseled Cap function transformed (May 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf) PCA / Tasseled Cap function transformed (November 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Darker) blue and red areas are generally unchanged - representing water (lakes/reservoir/sea), soil and built-up area. The pink areas are built-up areas / concrete / asphalt / human-made (e.g. southern inner bay’s long linear shape is the airport, and western area on the main island is the most populous town)\nGreenness in Fig. e is less than that in Fig. f, indicating the vegetation is less in May. During May (or generally spring time), there should be roughly similar amount of vegetation / crops, compared to November (autumn), while the crops during autumn reach maturity leading to more greenness in the latter figure.\nIt might also be the case that the light blue areas are soil moisture / higher humidity. As can be seen from both figures, the shaded blue areas in the central/slightly eastern-central location of the largest island is mountainous. The humidity can be higher there.\nAnother difference between the two images is that the redness is more intense in the first figure (more NIR?), while more organgy in the second. This indicates that the those areas are soil or bare areas. During autumn, the vegetation on those land increase, so the yellowness/greenness overlays.\n\n\n1.1.3.3.3 Landsat\nTo mitigate the atmospheric effects (cloudy and foggy from April to May and rainy during summer) (and also due to data availability), the sensing time for Landsat is in December.\n\n\n1.1.3.3.4 Compare spectral reflectance\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng) Spectral reflectance Sentinel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh) Spectral reflectance Landsat\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ranges of the datasets are different visually. Landsat has higher mean reflectance for all land cover in all bands.\nFor both sensors, the relationship between each land cover is similar, with water, forest and grass having lowest reflectance, and albeit less visible in Sentinel, bare earth having highest reflectance.\nThen, t-test is conducted to test the difference in average of the land cover reflectance between two sensors.\n\nTable 1. Welch two sample t-test (Sentinel and Landsat)\n\n\nlandcover\nt\ndf\np-value\n\n\n\n\nlow_urban\n-129.55\n2224.5\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nhigh_urban\n-289.79\n7115.3\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nbare_earth\n-223.36\n7141.2\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\ngrass\n-71.533\n674.71\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nforest\n-256.12\n7799.9\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nwater\n-175.3\n270.91\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\n\nSince p-values are all below 0.05, the difference in average reflectance of Landsat and of Sentinel data is statistically significant.\n\n\n\ni) Landsat vs. Sentinel (NASA, 2015)\n\n\nFig. i from NASA shows that spectral bands are similar between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, except TIRS. Hence, the comparison above is possible. However, the atmospheric transmission varies. Sentinel bands have higher atmospheric transmission rate (white areas) and relatively low reflectance across all land cover type. Conversely, most Landsat bands are in atmospheric windows (gery areas), which allow energy to pass through the atmosphere, thus resulting in higher reflectance. \n\n\n\n1.1.3.4 QGIS vs. SNAP\nQGIS:\n\neasy to check stuff / visualize outputs\n\nSNAP: pre-processing and analysing remotely sensed / raster data. For sentinel and other sensors comparison\n\nEasier to recreate TCC\nCan manually set the histogram / contract enhancement as in QGIS\nHaving data from multiple sensors in the same software that can be explored together\nbut it’s a pain to reopen a project.. and I found when setting up the project, it’s more straightforward to create a new project before opening up a product.\n\nTwo software can work together (using QGIS to check everything as did in CASA0005).\n\nwhen i checked GeoTIFFs and shapefiles in QGIS, nothing is shown.. so probably something went wrong when selecting POIs.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Questions\n\nwhy in the practical book before Landsat when resampling Sentinel, the equation for brightness does not include B11 and B12 (but using 0.5082 and 0.1863)?\nA: It should be B11 and B12.\nFig e looks different in terms of colour scheme? Since the majority of the city is coloured in blue, what do the blueish areas represent/mean (physically those areas are vegetations/forests, shouldn’t those be in green)?\nA: It depends on the colour gun set by the RGB."

    "text": "1.2 Application\nOne more question would be what possible factors contribute to the difference in mean reflectance analysed above and how to mitigate the difference. Apart from the atmospheric window discussed above, the temporal difference in the sensing date (19th November 2022 for Sentinel and 19th December 2022 for Landsat) might contribute to difference in atmospheric effects and in path radiance / noise from sky irradiance and radiance from surrounding areas. Hence, to increase data consistency and reduce reflectance difference for similar sensors, removing atmospheric effects and noise is needed this could be done through linear regression methods (e.g. to get surface reflectance for Sentinel using radiometric calibration method) (see Week 3). Moreover, Time-series-based Reflectance Adjustment (TRA) approach is developed to mitigate the drawbacks of fixed/global band transformation coefficients by considering difference in land cover type and locations (Shang and Zhu 2019a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHowever, if just using one sensor for analysis, there would be no/less concerns on the consistency issue?"

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nThere are so many wrong decisions made when producing this analysis. And without solid understanding of concepts/theories, the practical is like a maze 👾. It would be more efficient to do the practical after fully understanding every concept and data (although it is also rewarding to discover and learn from mistakes..). For instance, when comparing the spectral reflectance of Landsat and Sentinel, i selected band 1 to 7 for both sensors at first. However, after reading the paper by Shang and Zhu (2019b), i realized the wavelengths ranges/band numbers are different for both sensors (e.g. NIR is band 5 in Landsat while 8A for Sentinel.) After modifying this mistake, the overall patterns do not change much, albeit slight difference in t-statistics.\n\n\n\n\nShang, Rong, and Zhe Zhu. 2019b. “Harmonizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A Time-Series-Based Reflectance Adjustment Approach.” Remote Sensing of Environment 235 (December): 111439. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111439.\n\n\n———. 2019a. “Harmonizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A Time-Series-Based Reflectance Adjustment Approach.” Remote Sensing of Environment 235 (December): 111439. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111439."

(although some research due to political ends may alter their arguments? a bit dark tho😈)\nNational and global higher level policies and goals tend to be more generic and vague in terms of the solutions and approaches to reach the stated visions. Local policy and guidance, complying the higher level policies, tend to consider the contextual attributes. Thus, it can sometimes be difficult to provide one-size-fit-all solutions in local policy (and academic papers). Nevertheless, the case studies and more detailed guidelines may help in this context (from city planning perspective but many not for other themes like ecology and forestry), as well as the provision of tools and methods like the one on optimization of tree placement.\nSome challenges might not be under the control of the city. For instance, Green Belt is beyond the London metropolitan boundary and extend to wider areas. The regulation and effective maintenance might require collaboration from different local authorities.

(explore pixel resolution values at different scales > set pixel resolution when Map.addLayer)\n\n\nScale is related to the spatial resolution of the datasets. For example, the scale of Landsat-8 10m and 30m has the same value. why? - the nominal/native resolution of Landsat-8 is at 30m.\nScale can be influenced by zoom levels.\nFor different purpose of analysis, the resolution / scale would be different.

A1.2)\n\n\n\n\nmy first GEE GIF!\n\n\n\nFollowing the practical by (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.2), the above GIF shows the 2010-2020 changes in the area of the Kempegowda International Airport in India visually (its now the fourth busiest airport in the country). Then it would be helpful to quantify the change in the areas by classification.\n\n\nUrban / LCLU classification\n\n\nMany datasets are available, with different coverage and properties. The MODIS Land Cover Type Yearly Global can be used to map the changes in urban areas (it is the global dataset!) (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.2)\n\n\n\n5.2.2 UHI\n\nMODIS & Landsat (EE LST toolbox) can all be used to calculate land surface temperature (LST) (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.5). Since surface UHI is the urban temperature subtracts rural reference, the rural/urban classification in the previous section can be applied to 1) mask the urban area for analysis 2) calculate the difference between urban and rural LST.\n\n\n\nSurface Urban Heat Island in Kinmen\n\n\nWith reference to (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.5), the above map shows the spatial variability in Surface UHI in summers between 2014 and 2019 for Kinmen County using Landsat-8. (Red pixels: higher (diff.max=8°C); blue pixels: lower (diff.min=2°C). Summer temperature is used here to avoid the difference in seasons balancing out the peak values. The built-up area is quite small, as the county is still urbanizing slowly with a population of 140,843 within a 151.6 km2 area in 2022 as per Wikipedia. (Thus this might not be a proper site for analyzing UHI). However, the intensity of UHI is high in the most populous town Jincheng (with population density of 1,946 ppl/km2, whereas the whole county’s density is 929 ppl/km2). Plus, the usual residents is 40% of the total census population. The elderly who live alone take up a large share of the usual residents. High temperature in the urban areas may increase the threats to those vulnerable groups.\nAnother hotspot is in the central-south of the island which is the location of the Airport. More specifically, that is the location of the Airport hall, bus stops, taxi and car park, while the runway of the Airport is not classified as urban by MODIS (yet the LST is also high on runway). High reflectance of the road and building material, the absence of trees and vegetation and (possibly) the high volume of GHG emissions may contribute to the high temperature in this area compared to its rural neighbours.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Earth Engine APP\n\ndisplay large data and information quickly\ne.g. using sliders to change the year + changing cities\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Question\nI cannot figure out why i cannot export image on GEE.."

Sometimes using sliders takes time to load the data and makes the comparison less direct, while showing A/B diagrams in the report may be restricted to the limited specified set of years (e.g. 2010 and 2020, instead of all the available time).\nWhen calculating the UHI, several familiar concepts from week 1 reoccur like the different surface reflectance for materials being sampled to determine the land cover type - done by the MODIS dataset. The transformation of the data where the brightness temperature and emissivity (based on fractional vegetation cover from NDVI) are combined to find LST - done by the EE toolbox/module within a few steps.\n\n\n\n\nCardille, Jeffrey A., Gennadii Donchyts, Ujaval Gandhi, Txomin Hermosilla, Saverio Francini, Andréa P.
