And since the Sentinel data has been masked/selected useful bands for Tasseled cap, it will be masked again to select B1-B7.\nTo compare spectral reflectance: -> Make sure both data in the same resolution with the same bands -> Add polygons by land cover -> Export polygons as shapefiles -> Export both dataset as GeoTIFF -> Check in QGIS -> Compare in R using terra (or stars) => Fig. g,h & Table 1\n\n1.1.3.1 Sentinel and Landsat\n\nData availability depends on cloud cover, time, weather (sometimes study area may not have data under the filtered criteria)\nSentinel tends to have shorter download time than Landsat.\nLandsat has less available data in a given time range (due to slightly longer revisit time).\n\n\nSentinel and Landsat data in QGIS and SNAP\n\n\n\nSentinel-2\nLandsat (8-9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS))\n\n\n\n\nSpatial resolution\nResolutions varied for each bands.

Then change RGB channel to those new data to show results (Fig. e)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3.2 Masking vs. cropping\n\nmasking: the outline of the geo boundary\ncropping: to the extent, the rectangular parameter of the geo boundary\n\n\n\n1.1.3.3 Example: Processing of Sentinel and Landsat data of Kinmen County\nI’ve chosen Kinmen County in Taiwan as my case study area for practical. It consists of several islands and is in close proximity to Xiamen, China. The main/largest island is the H-shaped one at the lower end of the first few maps (or see Fig. e).\nThis is where i spent the majority of summer in 2022 so i’ve got some knowledge of the city/island’s land use. I also cycled a lot on this island (so having some sense of the topography). It is really enjoyable to cycle here as there is less traffic and more greenery. However, it tends to be slightly cloudy/rainy in certain months which may constrain the analysis. Anyhow, let’s see how it goes.\n\n1.1.3.3.1 Sentinel\nThe initial exploration using Sentinel data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Natural colour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb) False colour composite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc) Atmospheric penetration composite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd) Scatter plot (B4 Red - B8 NIR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse colour composite: B8, B4, B3. Plants reflect near-infrared and green light whilst absorbing red.\nAtmospheric penetration composite: B12, B11, B8A with no visible bands to penetrate atmospheric particles. Vegetation = blue, urban area = white, gray cyan or purple.\n\nBasically, Fig a,b,c show that the coastal city Xiamen’s built-up areas are mostly close to the seashore. This is mainly due to its historical ports that are open to international trades and thus becoming more urbanized. Kinmen Islands are less populous compared to Xiamen and the majority of land is bare soil / vegetation. Fig d shows that the dry bare soil is prominent in some areas (black dots at high B4 and high B8), while the image has large ratio of biomass (yellow peak at low B4 and high B8).\n\n\n1.1.3.3.2 Tasseled Cap function\nArcPro’s explanation:\nThe function is originally designed to monitor crop’s life cycle / changes through time.\n\nBrightness = bare or partially covered soil, man-made, and natural features such as concrete, asphalt, gravel, rock outcrops, and other bare areas\nGreenness = green vegetation\nWetness = soil moisture, water, and other moist features.\n\n✔️ Those three components of imagery contain about 97% of the meaningful information available in the image (removing noise and atmospheric effects).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne) PCA / Tasseled Cap function transformed (May 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf) PCA / Tasseled Cap function transformed (November 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Darker) blue and red areas are generally unchanged - representing water (lakes/reservoir/sea), soil and built-up area. The pink areas are built-up areas / concrete / asphalt / human-made (e.g. southern inner bay’s long linear shape is the airport, and western area on the main island is the most populous town)\nGreenness in Fig. e is less than that in Fig. f, indicating the vegetation is less in May. During May (or generally spring time), there should be roughly similar amount of vegetation / crops, compared to November (autumn), while the crops during autumn reach maturity leading to more greenness in the latter figure.\nIt might also be the case that the light blue areas are soil moisture / higher humidity. As can be seen from both figures, the shaded blue areas in the central/slightly eastern-central location of the largest island is mountainous. The humidity can be higher there.\nAnother difference between the two images is that the redness is more intense in the first figure (more NIR?), while more organgy in the second. This indicates that the those areas are soil or bare areas. During autumn, the vegetation on those land increase, so the yellowness/greenness overlays.\n\n\n1.1.3.3.3 Landsat\nTo mitigate the atmospheric effects (cloudy and foggy from April to May and rainy during summer) (and also due to data availability), the sensing time for Landsat is in December.\n\n\n1.1.3.3.4 Compare spectral reflectance\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng) Spectral reflectance Sentinel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh) Spectral reflectance Landsat\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ranges of the datasets are different visually. Landsat has higher mean reflectance for all land cover in all bands.\nFor both sensors, the relationship between each land cover is similar, with water, forest and grass having lowest reflectance, and albeit less visible in Sentinel, bare earth having highest reflectance.\nThen, t-test is conducted to test the difference in average of the land cover reflectance between two sensors.\n\nTable 1. Welch two sample t-test (Sentinel and Landsat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlandcover\nt\ndf\np-value\n\n\n\n\nlow_urban\n-129.55\n2224.5\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nhigh_urban\n-289.79\n7115.3\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nbare_earth\n-223.36\n7141.2\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\ngrass\n-71.533\n674.71\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nforest\n-256.12\n7799.9\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nwater\n-175.3\n270.91\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\n\nSince p-values are all below 0.05, the difference in average reflectance of Landsat and of Sentinel data is statistically significant.\n\n\n\ni) Landsat vs. Sentinel (NASA, 2015)\n\n\nFig. i from NASA shows that spectral bands are similar between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, except TIRS. Hence, the comparison above is possible. However, the atmospheric transmission varies. Sentinel bands have higher atmospheric transmission rate (white areas) and relatively low reflectance across all land cover type. Conversely, most Landsat bands are in atmospheric windows (gery areas), which allow energy to pass through the atmosphere, thus resulting in higher reflectance. \n\n\n\n1.1.3.4 QGIS vs. SNAP\nQGIS:\n\neasy to check stuff / visualize outputs\n\nSNAP: pre-processing and analysing remotely sensed / raster data. For sentinel and other sensors comparison\n\nEasier to recreate TCC\nCan manually set the histogram / contract enhancement as in QGIS\nHaving data from multiple sensors in the same software that can be explored together\nbut it’s a pain to reopen a project.. and I found when setting up the project, it’s more straightforward to create a new project before opening up a product.\n\nTwo software can work together (using QGIS to check everything as did in CASA0005).\n\nwhen i checked GeoTIFFs and shapefiles in QGIS, nothing is shown.. so probably something went wrong when selecting POIs.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Questions\n\nwhy in the practical book before Landsat when resampling Sentinel, the equation for brightness does not include B11 and B12 (but using 0.5082 and 0.1863)?\nA: It should be B11 and B12.\nFig e looks different in terms of colour scheme? Since the majority of the city is coloured in blue, what do the blueish areas represent/mean (physically those areas are vegetations/forests, shouldn’t those be in green)?\nA: It depends on the colour gun set by the RGB."

    "text": "1.2 Application\nOne more question would be what possible factors contribute to the difference in mean reflectance analysed above and how to mitigate the difference. Apart from the atmospheric window discussed above, the temporal difference in the sensing date (19th November 2022 for Sentinel and 19th December 2022 for Landsat) might contribute to difference in atmospheric effects and in path radiance / noise from sky irradiance and radiance from surrounding areas. Hence, to increase data consistency and reduce reflectance difference for similar sensors, removing atmospheric effects and noise is needed this could be done through linear regression methods (e.g. to get surface reflectance for Sentinel using radiometric calibration method) (see Week 3). Moreover, Time-series-based Reflectance Adjustment (TRA) approach is developed to mitigate the drawbacks of fixed/global band transformation coefficients by considering difference in land cover type and locations (Shang and Zhu 2019a).\n(However, if just using one sensor for analysis, there would be no/less concerns on the consistency issue?)"

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nThere are so many wrong decisions made when producing this analysis. And without solid understanding of concepts/theories, the practical is like a maze 👾. It would be more efficient to do the practical after fully understanding every concept and data (although it is also rewarding to discover and learn from mistakes..). For instance, when comparing the spectral reflectance of Landsat and Sentinel, i selected band 1 to 7 for both sensors at first. However, after reading the paper by Shang and Zhu (2019b), i realized the wavelengths ranges/band numbers are different for both sensors (e.g. NIR is band 5 in Landsat while 8A for Sentinel.) After modifying this mistake, the overall patterns do not change much, albeit slight difference in t-statistics.\n\n\n\n\nShang, Rong, and Zhe Zhu. 2019b. “Harmonizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A Time-Series-Based Reflectance Adjustment Approach.” Remote Sensing of Environment 235 (December): 111439. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111439.\n\n\n———. 2019a. “Harmonizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A Time-Series-Based Reflectance Adjustment Approach.” Remote Sensing of Environment 235 (December): 111439. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111439."
