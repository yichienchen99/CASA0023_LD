    "text": "1.1 Summary\n\n1.1.1 Sensors\nPassive\n\nAttribute: Sun energy reflection in EM wave, don’t emit EM waves\nExample: human eyes, satellite (e.g. Wk2 sensor summary - WorldView-3)\n❌ Influenced by atmosphere haze(require atmosphere correction, no haze in outer space due to no atmosphere) and scattering (wavelength (e.g. blue sky and orange sunset)), clouds and weather\n✔️ does not disturb the object or area of interest\n\nActive\n\nAttribute: Emit and receive EM wave / energy\nExample: radar, x-ray, LiDAR\n✔️ can pass clouds\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Four resolutions\n\nSpatial\n\nthe size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)\nLow spatial resolution: fast (short revisit time); High spatial resolution: costly\n\nSpectral\n\nSpectral signature (EM): Objects on Earth have difference wavelengths = Bands\n\nMulti-spectral data / image\nHyperspectral data / image: stack all colour bands\n\nTrue colour (human eye can see) and false colour (human cant see)\n❌ atmospheric window (atmospheric transmission / opacity, e.g. water vapour, ozone, CO…)\nSpectroradiometer\n\nRadiometric\n\nidentify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.\nIncrease bit -> increase possible values\n8-bit sensor: 0-255; 11-bit sensor: 0-2047\nSentinel-2 is 12-bit (brightness levels from 0 – 4095) (beyond True Colour Image (TCI) values)\n\nTemporal\n\nRevisit time of sensor\nHigh resolution / pixel -> low revisit = low cost and number [graph]\n\n\nTrade off between resolution and time (and cost)\n\n\n1.1.3 Practical\nOverview/Workflow (SNAP):\nDownload -> New project in SNAP -> Save downloaded file in a Data folder in the same directory as the project -> Open product/zipped data -> Select RGB-image channel (on product explorer panel right click product) => Fig. a,b,c\nTo inspect/change image display: -> Colour Manipulation panel (View -> Tool Windows) -> Change the range of histogram\nTo analyse spectral feature space: -> Scatter plot (under Analysis tab) => Fig. d\nTo mask the study area: -> Resampling to 20m (since both masking and the Tasseled Cap function require same resolution while B2/B3/B4/B8 are 10m and B11/B12 are 20m) -> Import vector (ESRI shapefile) -> Select the imported layer in layer manager -> Masking under Raster - Masks - Land/Sea Mask (select bands that would be used)\nTo reduce dimensionality via Tasseled Cap transformation : -> Apply transformation functions in Band Math -> Select RGB-image channel => Fig. e,f\nSince Landsat has different spatial resolution than Sentinel, the latter will be resampled again (upscale). And since the Sentinel data has been masked/selected useful bands for Tasseled cap, it will be masked again to select B1-B7.\nTo compare spectral reflectance: -> Make sure both data in the same resolution with the same bands -> Add polygons by land cover -> Export polygons as shapefiles -> Export both dataset as GeoTIFF -> Check in QGIS -> Compare in R using terra (or stars) => Fig. g,h & Table 1\n\n1.1.3.1 Sentinel and Landsat\n\nData availability depends on cloud cover, time, weather (sometimes study area may not have data under the filtered criteria)\nSentinel tends to have shorter download time than Landsat.\nLandsat has less available data in a given time range (due to slightly longer revisit time).\n\n\nSentinel and Landsat data in QGIS and SNAP\n\n\n\nSentinel-2\nLandsat (8-9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS))\n\n\n\n\nSpatial resolution\nResolutions varied for each bands.

Then change RGB channel to those new data to show results (Fig. e)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3.2 Masking vs. cropping\n\nmasking: the outline of the geo boundary\ncropping: to the extent, the rectangular parameter of the geo boundary\n\n\n\n1.1.3.3 Example: Processing of Sentinel and Landsat data of Kinmen County\nI’ve chosen Kinmen County in Taiwan as my case study area for practical. It consists of several islands and is in close proximity to Xiamen, China. The main/largest island is the H-shaped one at the lower end of the first few maps (or see Fig. e).\nThis is where i spent the majority of summer in 2022 so i’ve got some knowledge of the city/island’s land use. I also cycled a lot on this island (so having some sense of the topography). It is really enjoyable to cycle here as there is less traffic and more greenery. However, it tends to be slightly cloudy/rainy in certain months which may constrain the analysis. Anyhow, let’s see how it goes.\n\n1.1.3.3.1 Sentinel\nThe initial exploration using Sentinel data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Natural colour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb) False colour composite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc) Atmospheric penetration composite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd) Scatter plot (B4 Red - B8 NIR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse colour composite: B8, B4, B3. Plants reflect near-infrared and green light whilst absorbing red.\nAtmospheric penetration composite: B12, B11, B8A with no visible bands to penetrate atmospheric particles. Vegetation = blue, urban area = white, gray cyan or purple.\n\nBasically, Fig a,b,c show that the coastal city Xiamen’s built-up areas are mostly close to the seashore. This is mainly due to its historical ports that are open to international trades and thus becoming more urbanized. Kinmen Islands are less populous compared to Xiamen and the majority of land is bare soil / vegetation. Fig d shows that the dry bare soil is prominent in some areas (black dots at high B4 and high B8), while the image has large ratio of biomass (yellow peak at low B4 and high B8).\n\n\n1.1.3.3.2 Tasseled Cap function\nArcPro’s explanation:\nThe function is originally designed to monitor crop’s life cycle / changes through time.\n\nBrightness = bare or partially covered soil, man-made, and natural features such as concrete, asphalt, gravel, rock outcrops, and other bare areas\nGreenness = green vegetation\nWetness = soil moisture, water, and other moist features.\n\n✔️ Those three components of imagery contain about 97% of the meaningful information available in the image (removing noise and atmospheric effects).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne) PCA / Tasseled Cap function transformed (May 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf) PCA / Tasseled Cap function transformed (November 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Darker) blue and red areas are generally unchanged - representing water (lakes/reservoir/sea), soil and built-up area. The pink areas are built-up areas / concrete / asphalt / human-made (e.g. southern inner bay’s long linear shape is the airport, and western area on the main island is the most populous town)\nGreenness in Fig. e is less than that in Fig. f, indicating the vegetation is less in May. During May (or generally spring time), there should be roughly similar amount of vegetation / crops, compared to November (autumn), while the crops during autumn reach maturity leading to more greenness in the latter figure.\nIt might also be the case that the light blue areas are soil moisture / higher humidity. As can be seen from both figures, the shaded blue areas in the central/slightly eastern-central location of the largest island is mountainous. The humidity can be higher there.\nAnother difference between the two images is that the redness is more intense in the first figure (more NIR?), while more organgy in the second. This indicates that the those areas are soil or bare areas. During autumn, the vegetation on those land increase, so the yellowness/greenness overlays.\n\n\n1.1.3.3.3 Landsat\nTo mitigate the atmospheric effects (cloudy and foggy from April to May and rainy during summer) (and also due to data availability), the sensing time for Landsat is in December.\n\n\n1.1.3.3.4 Compare spectral reflectance\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng) Spectral reflectance Sentinel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh) Spectral reflectance Landsat\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ranges of the datasets are different visually. Landsat has higher mean reflectance for all land cover in all bands.\nFor both sensors, the relationship between each land cover is similar, with water, forest and grass having lowest reflectance, and albeit less visible in Sentinel, bare earth having highest reflectance.\nThen, t-test is conducted to test the difference in average of the land cover reflectance between two sensors.\n\nTable 1. Welch two sample t-test (Sentinel and Landsat)\n\n\nlandcover\nt\ndf\np-value\n\n\n\n\nlow_urban\n-129.55\n2224.5\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nhigh_urban\n-289.79\n7115.3\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nbare_earth\n-223.36\n7141.2\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\ngrass\n-71.533\n674.71\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nforest\n-256.12\n7799.9\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\nwater\n-175.3\n270.91\n< 2.2e-16\n\n\n\nSince p-values are all below 0.05, the difference in average reflectance of Landsat and of Sentinel data is statistically significant.\n\n\n\ni) Landsat vs. Sentinel (NASA, 2015)\n\n\nFig. i from NASA shows that spectral bands are similar between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, except TIRS. Hence, the comparison above is possible. However, the atmospheric transmission varies. Sentinel bands have higher atmospheric transmission rate (white areas) and relatively low reflectance across all land cover type. Conversely, most Landsat bands are in atmospheric windows (gery areas), which allow energy to pass through the atmosphere, thus resulting in higher reflectance. \n\n\n\n1.1.3.4 QGIS vs. SNAP\nQGIS:\n\neasy to check stuff / visualize outputs\n\nSNAP: pre-processing and analysing remotely sensed / raster data. For sentinel and other sensors comparison\n\nEasier to recreate TCC\nCan manually set the histogram / contract enhancement as in QGIS\nHaving data from multiple sensors in the same software that can be explored together\nbut it’s a pain to reopen a project.. and I found when setting up the project, it’s more straightforward to create a new project before opening up a product.\n\nTwo software can work together (using QGIS to check everything as did in CASA0005).\n\nwhen i checked GeoTIFFs and shapefiles in QGIS, nothing is shown.. so probably something went wrong when selecting POIs.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Questions\n\nwhy in the practical book before Landsat when resampling Sentinel, the equation for brightness does not include B11 and B12 (but using 0.5082 and 0.1863)?\nA: It should be B11 and B12.\nFig e looks different in terms of colour scheme? Since the majority of the city is coloured in blue, what do the blueish areas represent/mean (physically those areas are vegetations/forests, shouldn’t those be in green)?\nA: It depends on the colour gun set by the RGB."

    "text": "1.2 Application\nOne more question would be what possible factors contribute to the difference in mean reflectance analysed above and how to mitigate the difference. Apart from the atmospheric window discussed above, the temporal difference in the sensing date (19th November 2022 for Sentinel and 19th December 2022 for Landsat) might contribute to difference in atmospheric effects and in path radiance / noise from sky irradiance and radiance from surrounding areas. Hence, to increase data consistency and reduce reflectance difference for similar sensors, removing atmospheric effects and noise is needed this could be done through linear regression methods (e.g. to get surface reflectance for Sentinel using radiometric calibration method) (see Week 3). Moreover, Time-series-based Reflectance Adjustment (TRA) approach is developed to mitigate the drawbacks of fixed/global band transformation coefficients by considering difference in land cover type and locations (Shang and Zhu 2019a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHowever, if just using one sensor for analysis, there would be no/less concerns on the consistency issue?"

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nThere are so many wrong decisions made when producing this analysis. And without solid understanding of concepts/theories, the practical is like a maze 👾. It would be more efficient to do the practical after fully understanding every concept and data (although it is also rewarding to discover and learn from mistakes..). For instance, when comparing the spectral reflectance of Landsat and Sentinel, i selected band 1 to 7 for both sensors at first. However, after reading the paper by Shang and Zhu (2019b), i realized the wavelengths ranges/band numbers are different for both sensors (e.g. NIR is band 5 in Landsat while 8A for Sentinel.) After modifying this mistake, the overall patterns do not change much, albeit slight difference in t-statistics.\n\n\n\n\nShang, Rong, and Zhe Zhu. 2019b. “Harmonizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A Time-Series-Based Reflectance Adjustment Approach.” Remote Sensing of Environment 235 (December): 111439. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111439.\n\n\n———. 2019a. “Harmonizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A Time-Series-Based Reflectance Adjustment Approach.” Remote Sensing of Environment 235 (December): 111439. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111439."

Local policy and guidance, complying the higher level policies, tend to consider the contextual attributes. Thus, it can sometimes be difficult to provide one-size-fit-all solutions in local policy (and academic papers). Nevertheless, the case studies and more detailed guidelines may help in this context (from city planning perspective but many not for other themes like ecology and forestry), as well as the provision of tools and methods like the one on optimization of tree placement.\nSome challenges might not be under the control of the city. For instance, Green Belt is beyond the London metropolitan boundary and extend to wider areas. The regulation and effective maintenance might require collaboration from different local authorities.

A1.2)\n\n\n\n\nmy first GEE GIF!\n\n\n\nFollowing the practical by (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.2), the above GIF shows the 2010-2020 changes in the area of the Kempegowda International Airport in India visually (its now the fourth busiest airport in the country). Then it would be helpful to quantify the change in the areas by classification.\n\n\nUrban / LCLU classification\n\n\nMany datasets are available, with different coverage and properties. The MODIS Land Cover Type Yearly Global can be used to map the changes in urban areas (it is the global dataset!) (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.2)\n\n\n\n5.2.2 UHI\n\nMODIS & Landsat (EE LST toolbox) can all be used to calculate land surface temperature (LST) (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.5). Since surface UHI is the urban temperature subtracts rural reference, the rural/urban classification in the previous section can be applied to 1) mask the urban area for analysis 2) calculate the difference between urban and rural LST.\n\n\n\nSurface Urban Heat Island in Kinmen\n\n\nWith reference to (Wang et al., n.d., chap. A1.5), the above map shows the spatial variability in Surface UHI in summers between 2014 and 2019 for Kinmen County using Landsat-8. (Red pixels: higher (diff.max=8°C); blue pixels: lower (diff.min=2°C). Summer temperature is used here to avoid the difference in seasons balancing out the peak values. The built-up area is quite small, as the county is still urbanizing slowly with a population of 140,843 within a 151.6 km2 area in 2022 as per Wikipedia. (Thus this might not be a proper site for analyzing UHI). However, the intensity of UHI is high in the most populous town Jincheng (with population density of 1,946 ppl/km2, whereas the whole county’s density is 929 ppl/km2). Plus, the usual residents is 40% of the total census population. The elderly who live alone take up a large share of the usual residents. High temperature in the urban areas may increase the threats to those vulnerable groups.\nAnother hotspot is in the central-south of the island which is the location of the Airport. More specifically, that is the location of the Airport hall, bus stops, taxi and car park, while the runway of the Airport is not classified as urban by MODIS (yet the LST is also high on runway). High reflectance of the road and building material, the absence of trees and vegetation and (possibly) the high volume of GHG emissions may contribute to the high temperature in this area compared to its rural neighbours.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Earth Engine APP\n\ndisplay large data and information quickly\ne.g. using sliders to change the year + changing cities\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Question\nI cannot figure out why i cannot export image on GEE.."

This supports analysis on LULC, urban expansion, urban green space, illegal logging, forest fire, etc.\n\n6.2.1 CART & Random Forest\nAs done in the practical, the Sentinel data is classified using CART and RF. When selecting training data (selecting land cover geometries as variables), the false inference on the landuse and the inclusion of other land cover type in the geometry may add noise to the prediction, hence lowering the accuracy. Also, mentioned in the practical, when splitting the data into training and testing (for accuracy testing), the pixels of the selected geometries should be used, rather than the geometry that may add more noise to the results.\n\n\n\nOutput from practical - land cover classification using CART\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput from practical - land cover classification using RF\n\n\nThe accuracy is not as high as Andy’s output. For RF, the OOB error is 6%.. and the accuracy is 93%. Resubstitution accuracy is 99% (original training data vs. model output). When comparing testing data and model output, the accuracy gives 93%. > Is there any correlations between OOB accuracy and the confusion matrix? (and is it possible to add the legend to the output?)\nComparing two outputs visually, RF captures the difference in high and low urban land cover types better than CART. However, both methods produce outputs that seems like salt and pepper since they are pixel-based. Although the low urban type might exist in the forest (like meterological stations), it might not be necessary when drawing out the forest boundary. Object-based methods could be used for this purpose and for higher resolution building boundary detection for instance.\n\n\n6.2.2 SVM\n[Technical / methods] Study by (Ustuner, Sanli, and Dixon 2015) constructs the a classification model for agricultural landuse in Turkey using SVM method with RapidEye imargery. With fieldwork and Google Earth information on land cover types, it compares the classification accuracy with the result from Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and internally among the results using different parameters (error penalty (C), gamma, bias term (r), polynomial degree (d)) and kernel types (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid). Accuracy is assessed through kappa coefficient (comparing classified images against ground truth data). Results show that the SVM method outperforms MLC and classification accuracy is influenced by the choice of parameters (and kernels) (Ustuner, Sanli, and Dixon 2015). However, the generalization performance of kernels is influenced by the types of dataset (multi- or hyper-spectural or SAR…) so the conclusion on the best-performing kernel type is not fixed (may vary due to dataset).\n[Context / application] The country’s agricultural productivity highly influence its economy. However, the data on agricultural statistics is manually collected by government employees from farmers’ declaration. The data could be unreliable (Ustuner, Sanli, and Dixon 2015) and labour-intensive, being not cost-effective for the government. Hence, methods like applying image classification on remote sensing data could provide viable, up-to-data and reliable information for sustainable crop management and planning. Before putting into practice, the sensitivity / reliability of the methods is tested through comparing between different models and within SVM using different parameters and kernels. The best combination of parameter and kernel will be used to inform decisions.\n\n\n\n(Ustuner, Sanli and Dixon, 2015)\n\n\n[Result / recommendation] The above output shows highest accuracy selections (compared to results from other models with different error penalty in the same kernel) of four different kernels from SVM + the result from MLC. Kappa for MS9 = 0.8209, MR5 = 0.8222, ML11 = 0.8223, MP9 = 0.8411. >> Recommendation from the authors: optimum parameters for SVM should be analyzed in detail before choosing one for best classification result.\nAnother study by (Pal and Mather 2005) suggests that SVM (using pair-wise comparison for multi-class) achieves higher accuracy than ML and ANN. Nevertheless, effective use depends on the values of a few user‐defined parameters. SVM in dealing with multi-class: n hyperplanes should be determined (comparing one class with the rest > may produce unclassified data, hence lowing the accuracy) or n(n-1)/2 classifiers (pair-wise comparison) (Pal and Mather 2005)."

Estimating population based on building outline seems less convincing as the building height data is not assessed. This could be solved by combining the method of detecting building shades from satellite imagery and sample building height annotations with longitude, latitude, and elevation from the ICESat-2, ATL03 photons (Zhao et al. 2023). Hence, a 3D building data can be used to estimate population more accurately. However, the population density per building may vary spatially and over time, influenced by the building functions. Offices for instance should be omitted during prediction. The detailed land use type per building may be beyond the scope of remote sensing data. That said, population estimation for informal settlements can be valuable, which is not included in the census data.\nHumanitarian response: the location and density of settlements could be used to evaluate the risk zones and potential loss due to natural disasters, integrated with deep learning from data like past disaster events, social media, and weather reports to forecast the affected areas and consolidate early-warning system. Te detailed methods may subject to the types of disasters (flooding/earthquake/landslide/volcanic eruptions..). Corresponding interventions (e.g. relocation of hospitals and residence within the risk zones) in relation to the local demographics of vulnerable groups can be integrated to reduce risks, complying to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk reduction 2015-2030. Nevertheless, the LULC classifications may already achieve this goal, albeit without building outline..\nAddressing systems & Statistical indicators: the location of buildings can be used to simulate transport demands and routing, hence planning a more robust transport system.\n\nOther possible uses of the data:\n\nPlanning support: The space between buildings / street width could be useful for analyzing the environmental conditions in urban public realm, guiding regulations on building heights – narrow streets with high buildings should be avoided, increasing wind speed and reducing daylight penetration.\n\n\n\n7.2.2.2 Accuracy\nThe accuracy is enhanced through the novel method using U-Net Model (mixup, self-training, distance weighting with Gaussian convolutions, and residual decoder blocks) (Sirko et al., n.d.). For randomly selected test data (Figure2c), the areas with potential bias are omitted, including those with vast rural land and empty area (.ibid).\n\n\n\n(Sirko et al, 2021)\n\n\nU-Net Model originates from biomed image semantic segmentation (Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox 2015; Li et al. 2021), having wide range of applications in different fields, outperforming the original sliding-window convolutional network.\n\n\n\nU-Net Architecture (Ronneberger, Fischer and Brox, 2015)\n\n\nThe performance of open building data can be accessed from the confidence score. However, there is difference in the performance spatially. Some areas like single building in rural area and dessert terrain can have lower accuracy (Sirko et al., n.d.). In urban areas, large buildings may be split into smaller ones, with most cases seen in Egypt - Cairo (ibid.).\n\n\n\n(Sirko et al, 2021)"

    "text": "8.1 Summary\nThis week’s lecture goes into the application of remote sensing data on urban temperature / Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigation (mentioned under week 4 policy section of this learning diary as well) through several policy case studies in different cities/countries. This section will elaborate UHI impacts and some limitations of related policies.\n\n8.1.1 UHI and its impacts\nUHI is correlated with the material (e.g. darker surfaces absorb and retain more heat than reflective ones), vegetation that cools the environment through evapotranspiration and shading, building heights and road widths (e.g. low Sky View Factor reduces outgoing longwave radiation), hard surface that reduces the emitance of heat (as opposed to vegetation/soft surface) and air speed, etc. Some of the factors may also related to others. For example, low SVF with clusters of high-rise buildings can sometimes cause high wind speed and reflective building material.\nUHI has wide impacts socially, economically and environmentally on urban areas and its periphery:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npillars\nimpacts\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\nHeat-related illness\nHigher mortality rate\n\n\n\nEconomic\n\nLower GDP in some areas\nLocal government and related sectors increase spending on coping with UHI impacts\n\n\n\nEnvironmental\n\nPositive feedback loop where people would use more energy for cooling at high temperature, increasing GHG emissions which further contributing to higher temperature..\nRising use of energy (burning fossil fuels) increases air pollution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 UHI and policy response\nDifferent policy strategies and scales can have varying outcomes on GHG emissions and related UHI impacts at non-identical rates. Global policies (and national policies) are broader and context-less, guiding the overall directions and providing some standard indicators (like New Urban Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals). In some ways, global policies may boost creativity and diversity in approaches to climate mitigation and adaptations.\nLocal policies tend to be more detailed, considering the context and implementation. However, the actual interventions/projects can diverge from the policy statements due to several reasons. First, limited resources (funding/technique/human capital) slow down policy enforcement by the government and other stakeholders. For example, (in the British planning system) the viability assessment can be provided by the developers to claim/negotiate for a lower amount of affordable housing provision than initially planned in the application to ensure the project delivery and viability (and so can the green infrastructure provision be reduced by this means!). Second, the quality of green infrastructure is usually not guaranteed, relying on the developers’ efforts. Plus, the interventions may not be in the location of demands. Usually people with more decision-making power vote for plans benefiting the wealthier neighborhoods, where people are less affected by the heat, neglecting the poorer ones (e.g. informal settlements). Third, implementations take time to become effective or accepted by the public, while the change in political conditions can influence the project objectives. Introducing projects that are operated by businesses and funded by the government, benefiting the public, would effectively mitigate this challenge as the external political factors may have limited impacts on project delivery."

    "text": "8.2 Application\nRemote sensing data steps in to cope with the detection of factors related to urban heat. For instance, albedo could be classified through LULC. Areas/buildings with reflective roofs would be areas of focus on introducing green roofs. Also, land surface temperature could be monitored using Sentinel data. The census/demographic data (or other social background information like redlining areas) can be incorporated into the temperature analysis, uncovering places that are most in need of mitigation and adaptation, providing equitable solutions to the residents while making justice changes to the neighborhood.\nThe building outline (pre)classified data such as Google open building data (see last week’s application section) can be applied to investigate urban morphology, implying street width and suggesting appropriate building height for each application. This could be included in the planning process at site-level, rather than using current planning guidance that depends on some zoning / special area regulation which is at area-scale and negotiable. The figure-ground map could also be used to masterplan the transport system. Borrowing the idea from Barcelona superblocks, the transformation of roads could be low-cost solution to promote sustainable mobility."

    "text": "8.3 Reflection\nThe applications of remote sensing data tend to be passive and focus on the aftermath analysis of urban challenges (heat/temperature and climate change, as well as natural disasters and illegal logging, etc.). This may be less valuable in reversing and recovering the loss to the city.\nFront-ended/active applications like incorporating the optimization of tree placement in the planning process through remote sensing techniques should increase the spread to cover more expansive areas. More similar approaches could be developed to increase the awareness of the applicability and usefulness of remote sensing data. It would also be valuable to form the quadruple helix collaboration between government, industry, academia and the public to develop innovative business plans for such applications, ensuring long-term use and maintenance.\nNevertheless, barriers in remote sensing data such as the temporal resolution and accuracy may limit the application scope. Although there could be efficient and reproducible project management plans, the actual acquisition of data may be time-consuming, lagging the data processing and analysis, delaying the interventions and rapid response. Comparable indicators/methods and agreed analytic frameworks would be needed to cope with the great diversity of contextual scenarios. Plus, the remote sensing surface temperature may not imply the trend of air temperature experienced by normal human.. This could be further proved with increasing the coverage of temperature sensors."
