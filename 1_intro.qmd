## Summary

### Sensors

-   Passive (Sun energy reflection in EM wave, don't emit EM waves)

    -   Example: human eyes, satellite

    -   Con: Atmosphere Haze (require atmosphere correction, no haze in outer space due to no atmosphere) and scattering (wavelength (e.g. blue sky and orange sunset)), clouds and weather

-   Active (emit and receive EM wave / energy)

    -   Example: radar, x-ray, LiDAR

    -   Pro: can pass clouds

### Four resolutions

1.  Spatial

    -   Pro: fast

    -   Con: costly

2.  Spectral

    -   Spectral signature (EM): Objects on Earth have difference wavelengths = Bands

        -   Multi-spectral data / image

        -   Hyperspectral data / image: stack all colour bands

    -   True colour (human eye can see) and false colour (human cant see)

    -   Con: atmospheric window (atmospheric transmission / opacity, e.g. water vapour, ozone, CO...)

    -   Spectroradiometer

3.  Radiometric

    -   Cell/ pixel

    -   Increase bit -\> increase possible values

    -   8-bit

4.  Temporal

    -   Revisit time of sensor

    -   High resolution / pixel -\> low revisit = low cost and number \[graph\]

Trade off between resolution and time (and cost)
