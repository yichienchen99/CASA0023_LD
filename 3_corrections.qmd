## Summary

### Corrections

1.  Geometric Corrections

    Ground central point: GCP

    :   Objects (e.g. building) on the image that do not move, as the reference point of corrections.

    -   Coordinates of each GCP -\> linear regression

    -   Forward mapping

        Forward mapping

        :   X: original image -\> Y: target image

        ❌possibility of points outside 'gold standard' (the rectified/targeted image)

    -   Backward mapping

        Backward mapping

        :   X: target image -\> Y: original image

        ✔️ use points on 'gold standard' to match point on original data

    -   Reduce error \<- increase GCP

    -   Requirement for corrections:

        1.  same resolution (resampling)
        2.  same CRS (reprojecting)

2.  Atmospheric Corrections

    -   To mitigate the effect of scattering and absorption & to avoid loss of reflectance & signiture extension thorough space and time [@jensen2015]

    -   Point Spread Function

        Point Spread Function

        :   spectral signature

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   Relative

        1.  DOS

            ❌ assuming unusual brightness of darkest pixel as atmosphere

        2.  PIFs

            Use middle of years, Y: base image

    -   Absolute

        ❌ High data requirement (fieldwork/...); High software requirement (costy)

    -   ELC

        field data

        surface reflectance

        total irradiance

        total radiance

3.  Topographic Corrections (Orthorectification)

    -   Require: sensor geometry & elevation model

    -   Should be done after atmospheric corrections

    <!-- -->

    -   Cosine Function: $LH=LT\frac{cosθO}{cosi}$

        Cosine Function

        :   tst

        Zenith

        :   the

        Azimuth

        :   ths

4.  Radiometric Corrections

    -   Digital number of each pixel = raw, unitless

    -   Regression = unit

    -   Reflectance (BOA) = comparable

    -   TOA radiance -\> TOA reflectance = no light

    -   Surface reflectance = no light, no atmosphere

    -   Hemispherical reflectance (e.g. in Labs)

    -   Apparent reflectance

### Enhancement

1.  Feathering / joining

    -   GEE: median

    -   surface reflectance data not comparable -\> standardization, normalization

2.  Image Enhancement

    1.  Contract enhancement (QGIS)

        not changing data, but changing display

    2.  Ratioing

        divide / compare bands with each other, normalized surface reflectance

    3.  Filtering

    4.  PCA

    5.  Texture analysis

        1st order occurrence: ✔️classification

        Edge of building enhanced via 1st order variance

        2nd order co-occurrence: ✔️classification improvement and additional info (to other bands)

        can then be used in PCA

    6.  Fusion

        Combine bands from different sensors / texture analysis layer

        Resampling - different pixel/location

        -   Decision

        -   Object

        -   Image

            Pan sharpen: for better visualization

### Questions

## Application

### Corrections

1.  Geometric Corrections: [Redlining in the US](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/42.366/-71.262&city=cambridge-ma).

    The historical maps/plans were drawn by hands. Those maps were digitized through geometric corrections, allowing the research/manipulation of this database on housing policy relating to socio-economic wellbeing and zoning.
